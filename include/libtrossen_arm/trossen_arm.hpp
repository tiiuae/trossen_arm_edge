  //   - if caught
  //     - the main thread leaves the try-catch block as is
  //     - optimally, the driver can be cleaned up and configured again
  // - if an exception is thrown in the daemon thread
  //   - the exception is stored in exception_ptr_
  //   - the daemon thread returns
  //   - at the next function call in the main thread, the exception is rethrown
