========================
Trossen AI Configuration
========================

In order to use the Trossen AI Kits with LeRobot, you need to identify specifications for your setup.
The specifications include the IP address, model_name, and camera serial numbers.
we will pass the specifications in as arguments using ``--robot.ip_address``, ``--robot.type``, and ``--robot.cameras``.


The following steps will guide you on how to configure the Trossen AI Kits with LeRobot.

The configuration File for the follower arm for the Trossen AI Kits with LeRobot can be found in :guilabel:`lerobot_trossen/packages/lerobot_robot_trossen/src/lerobot_robot_trossen`.

The configuration File for the leader arm for the Trossen AI Kits with LeRobot can be found in :guilabel:`lerobot_trossen/packages/lerobot_teleoperation_trossen/src/lerobot_teleoperation_trossen`.

Setup IP Address
----------------

.. note::

    By default, the IP address for a Trossen AI arm is set to ``192.168.1.2``.
    Make sure to change the IP addresses of your Trossen AI arms to match the ones that will be passed in the arguments.

To set up the IP address for the Trossen AI Arms, you must first ensure that the arms are connected to the same network as your computer.
Refer to :ref:`Arm Network Setup <getting_started/software_setup:Arm Network Setup>` for correct connection instructions.
Once connected, you can find or configure the IP address using the :ref:`getting_started/demo_scripts:`configure_cleanup`_` demo or the :ref:`getting_started/demo_scripts:`set_ip_method`_` and :ref:`getting_started/demo_scripts:`set_manual_ip`_` demos.

Camera Serial Number
--------------------

There are two ways to set up the camera serial numbers for the Trossen AI Kits with LeRobot: using the RealSense interface or the OpenCV interface.
Based on the camera interface you choose, follow the appropriate steps below to set up the camera serial numbers.

Camera serial numbers are required to uniquely identify each camera connected to your system.
You will pass the cameras as a dictionary argument using ``--robot.cameras``.

The dictionary will look like this for two cameras:

.. tabs::
    .. group-tab:: RealSense Interface

        .. code-block:: bash

            --robot.cameras="{
                cam_main: {type: intelrealsense, serial_number_or_name: "0123456789", width: 640, height: 480, fps: 30},
                cam_wrist: {type: intelrealsense, serial_number_or_name: "0123456789", width: 640, height: 480, fps: 30}
            }"

    .. group-tab:: OpenCV Interface

        .. code-block:: bash

            --robot.cameras="{
                cam_main: {type: opencv, index_or_path: 8, width: 640, height: 480, fps: 30},
                cam_wrist: {type: opencv, index_or_path: 10, width: 640, height: 480, fps: 30}
            }"

We will look at setting up the specific camera types in more detail below.

            .. note::

                If realsense-viewer is not already installed on your machine, follow `these steps on the librealsense GitHub repository <https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/doc/distribution_linux.md>`_  to install ``librealsense2-utils``.

        #.  Plug in a single camera and check the sidebar for its entry.
            If it does not show up in the side bar, click Add Source and find the Intel RealSense D405 in the drop down.

            .. note::

                Troubleshooting: If the camera does not show up in the sidebar after plugging it in, try a hardware reset.

        #.  Click on Info for the camera, find the Serial Number, and copy it.

        #.  Repeat for the rest of the cameras.

        .. note::

            For best practices on multi-camera setups, refer to `Multi-Camera configurations - D400 Series Stereo Cameras <https://dev.realsenseai.com/docs/multiple-depth-cameras-configuration>`_ .

    .. group-tab:: OpenCV Interface

        The `OpenCVCamera <https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/tree/main/src/lerobot/cameras/opencv/>`_ class in the original lerobot repository allows you to record frames from most cameras using the `opencv2 <https://docs.opencv.org>`_ library.
        For more details on compatibility, see `Video I/O with OpenCV Overview <https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d0/da7/videoio_overview.html>`_.

        #.  To find the camera indices, run the following utility script, which will save a few frames from each detected camera:

            .. code-block:: bash

                uv run lerobot-find-cameras opencv

            The output will look something like this if you have two cameras connected:

                **Multiple Color Streams on Intel RealSense D405 (OpenCV Behavior)**
                
                When using the Intel® RealSense™ D405, you may observe two different "color" images in OpenCV: one bright and natural-looking, and another slightly dull. 
                This behavior is expected and results from the D405's internal hardware architecture.
                
                **Internal Camera Architecture**
                
                The D405 contains:
                
                - A stereo depth module (D401) with left and right global shutter imagers
                - A dedicated RGB sensor (OmniVision OV9782)
                - An onboard Image Signal Processor (ISP) for RGB processing
                
                The camera exposes multiple video streams as separate UVC endpoints:
                
                - **UYVY (Left Stereo Imager)** - Originates from the stereo depth sensor, optimized for depth matching (not color accuracy), limited color fidelity, appears flatter or duller
                - **YUY2 (RGB Sensor OV9782 via ISP)** - Comes from the dedicated RGB sensor, processed through the ISP (white balance, demosaicing, color correction, gamma, exposure control), produces a bright, natural-looking image
                
                **Visual Comparison:**
                
                .. list-table::
                   :widths: 50 50

                          :align: center
                          
                          UYVY stream from left stereo imager (dull appearance)
                     
                     - .. figure:: images/rgb_sensor_yuy2.png
                          :alt: YUY2 - RGB Sensor via ISP (bright, natural)
                          :align: center
                          
                          YUY2 stream from RGB sensor via ISP (bright, natural)
                
                **Which Stream Should Be Used?**
                
                For robotics, object detection, visual servoing, and color-based processing: **Use the brighter YUY2 stream** (RGB sensor OV9782 via ISP). 
                The UYVY stream is primarily useful for stereo debugging or low-level inspection of the depth imager.
                
                Review the captured images in ``outputs/captured_images`` and select the video index that provides the bright, natural-looking YUY2 RGB stream.

        #. Find all the camera indices and put them in the appropriate dictionary items as specified above.
