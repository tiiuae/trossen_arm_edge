Trossen AI Configuration
========================

.. note::

    Ongoing support for the LeRobot fork is deprecated.
    We recommend using the :doc:`plugin-based LeRobot integration <../lerobot_plugin>` instead.

    However, this integration is necessary for users who wish to use the :doc:`openpi integration <../openpi>`.

In order to use the Trossen AI Kits with LeRobot, you need to first configure the arms with the necessary specifications.
The specifications include the IP address, model_name, and camera serial numbers.
The following steps will guide you on how to configure the Trossen AI Kits with LeRobot.

This is an example of a configuration file for the Trossen AI Kits with LeRobot, you can find this in :guilabel:`lerobot/common/robot_devices/robots/configs.py`:

Setup IP Address
----------------

.. note::

    By default, the IP address for a Trossen AI arm is set to ``192.168.1.2``.
    Make sure to change the IP addresses of your Trossen AI arms to match the ones in the configuration file.

To set up the IP address for the Trossen AI Arms, you must first ensure that the arms are connected to the same network as your computer.
Refer to the :ref:`PC Network Setup guide <getting_started/software_setup:PC Network Setup>` for correct connection instructions.
Once connected, you can find or configure the IP address using the :ref:`getting_started/demo_scripts:`configure_cleanup`_` demo or the :ref:`getting_started/demo_scripts:`set_ip_method`_` and :ref:`getting_started/demo_scripts:`set_manual_ip`_` demos.

Camera Serial Number
--------------------

There are two ways to set up the camera serial numbers for the Trossen AI Kits with LeRobot: using the Intel RealSense interface or the OpenCV interface.
Based on the camera interface you choose, follow the appropriate steps below to set up the camera serial numbers.
You can setup both interfaces at the same time, and use the ``--robot.camera_interface`` argument to switch between them.
By default, the camera interface is set to ``intel_realsense``.
We will look at this in more detail in the next sections.

        #.  Open realsense-viewer

            .. code-block:: bash

            .. note::

                If realsense-viewer is not already installed on your machine, follow `these steps on the librealsense GitHub repository <https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/doc/distribution_linux.md>`_  to install ``librealsense2-utils``.

        #.  Plug in a single camera and check the sidebar for its entry.
            If it does not show up in the side bar, click Add Source and find the Intel RealSense D405 in the drop down.

        #.  Click on Info for the camera, find the Serial Number, and copy it.

        #.  Repeat for the rest of the cameras.

    .. group-tab:: OpenCV Interface

        The `OpenCVCamera <https://github.com/Interbotix/lerobot/blob/trossen-ai/lerobot/common/robot_devices/cameras/opencv.py>`_ class allows you to efficiently record frames from most cameras using the `opencv2 <https://docs.opencv.org>`_ library.
        For more details on compatibility, see `Video I/O with OpenCV Overview <https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d0/da7/videoio_overview.html>`_.

        To instantiate an `OpenCVCamera <https://github.com/Interbotix/lerobot/blob/trossen-ai/lerobot/common/robot_devices/cameras/opencv.py>`_, you need a camera index (e.g. :guilabel:`OpenCVCamera(camera_index=0)`).
        When you only have one camera like a webcam of a laptop, the camera index is usually ``0`` but it might differ, and the camera index might change if you reboot your computer or re-plug your camera.
        This behavior depends on your operating system.


        #.  To find the camera indices, run the following utility script, which will save a few frames from each detected camera:

            .. code-block:: bash

                python lerobot/common/robot_devices/cameras/opencv.py \
                --images-dir outputs/images_from_opencv_cameras

            The output will look something like this if you have two cameras connected:

            .. code-block:: bash

                Mac or Windows detected. Finding available camera indices through scanning all indices from 0 to 60

        #. Check the saved images in :guilabel:`outputs/images_from_opencv_cameras` to identify which camera index corresponds to which physical camera (e.g. ``0`` for ``camera_00`` or ``1`` for ``camera_01``):

            .. note::

                **Multiple Color Streams on Intel RealSense D405 (OpenCV Behavior)**
                
                When using the Intel® RealSense™ D405, you may observe two different "color" images in OpenCV: one bright and natural-looking, and another slightly dull. 
                This behavior is expected and results from the D405's internal hardware architecture.
                
                **Internal Camera Architecture**
                
                The D405 contains:
                
                - A stereo depth module (D401) with left and right global shutter imagers
                - A dedicated RGB sensor (OmniVision OV9782)
                - An onboard Image Signal Processor (ISP) for RGB processing
                
                The camera exposes multiple video streams as separate UVC endpoints:
                
                - **UYVY (Left Stereo Imager)** - Originates from the stereo depth sensor, optimized for depth matching (not color accuracy), limited color fidelity, appears flatter or duller
                - **YUY2 (RGB Sensor OV9782 via ISP)** - Comes from the dedicated RGB sensor, processed through the ISP (white balance, demosaicing, color correction, gamma, exposure control), produces a bright, natural-looking image
                
                **Visual Comparison:**
                
                .. list-table::
                   :widths: 50 50
                   
                   * - .. figure:: images/left_stereo_imager_uyvy.png
                          :alt: UYVY - Left Stereo Imager (dull appearance)
                          :align: center
                          
                          UYVY stream from left stereo imager (dull appearance)
                     
                     - .. figure:: images/rgb_sensor_yuy2.png
                          :alt: YUY2 - RGB Sensor via ISP (bright, natural)
                          :align: center
                          
                          YUY2 stream from RGB sensor via ISP (bright, natural)
                
                **Which Stream Should Be Used?**
                
                For robotics, object detection, visual servoing, and color-based processing: **Use the brighter YUY2 stream** (RGB sensor OV9782 via ISP). 
                The UYVY stream is primarily useful for stereo debugging or low-level inspection of the depth imager.
                
                Review the captured images and select the video index that provides the bright, natural-looking YUY2 RGB stream.
