   This is an experimental tutorial and may change in the future.
   Minimal testing has been done on the Trossen AI setup.
   Results may vary.

This guide walks through the use of the `openpi <https://github.com/trossenRobotics/openpi>`_ framework with Trossen AI arms.

Background and Disclaimers
==========================

Refer to the following papers to understand the model architecture and training procedure:

- `π0 Paper <https://www.physicalintelligence.company/download/pi0.pdf>`_
- `π0.5 Paper <https://www.physicalintelligence.company/download/pi05.pdf>`_

Look into the limitations section for known issues and challenges.
As mentioned in the paper, high-quality datasets are required to get good results.

    *"Our experiments imply that an analogous phenomenon might take place with robot foundation models, where pre-trained models have some zero-shot capabilities, but complex tasks like laundry following require fine-tuning with high-quality data.
    Training on only this high-quality data results in a brittle model that does not reliably recover from mistakes, while running the pre-trained model in zero shot does not always exhibit the fluent strategies demonstrated in the post-training data."*

The paper also mentions its experimental setup and success results, which can be used as a reference for your own experiments.
One such setup is mentioned as follows:

    *"Shirt folding: Shirt folding is recorded as either success or failure.
    We begin each shirt folding eval by laying the shirt flat on the table.
    Success is defined as having folded in the sleeves and performed one half-fold along the length of the shirt.
    Our eval includes 4 small t-shirts and 1 medium t-shirt.
    We run 2 evals for each item for a maximum of 15000 steps or approximately 5 minutes each.""*

The following figure presents the the results from the original paper, showing average scores per task over 10 trials.
The scoring rubrics are mentioned in the paper appendix.
A score of 1.0 represents a perfect execution, while partial scores correspond to partially completed tasks (e.g., 0.5 for a shirt that is half-folded).

The original π0 results are provided here to set expectations.
Since Trossen AI arms were not part of the original π0 training dataset, performance may be weaker out of the box.
However, we found that fine-tuning on a small, high-quality dataset can still yield useful performance.
See the :ref:`tutorials/openpi:Results` section of this guide for details.

This tutorial walks you through:

- Collecting episodes
- Training with OpenPi
- Fine-tuning using LoRA
- Evaluating policies
- Running inference

.. note::

    This workflow uses three different versions of LeRobot for different stages:

    - **Data Collection**: LeRobot v2.1 (``Interbotix/lerobot``) - Collects episodes in LeRobot Dataset v2 format
    - **Training**: LeRobot v0.1.0 (OpenPI dependency) - Compatible with LeRobot Dataset v2 format for training
    - **Inference**: LeRobot v0.4.0 - Uses the hardware plugin system and is independent of dataset format

    **Installation Locations:**

    - **LeRobot v0.1.0** (training) is installed at ``.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/lerobot``
    - **LeRobot v0.4.0** (inference) is installed at ``examples/trossen_ai/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/lerobot``

    **Where to Run Commands:**

    - **Training commands**: Run from the project root (uses LeRobot v0.1.0)
    - **Inference commands**: Run from ``examples/trossen_ai`` directory (uses LeRobot v0.4.0)

    This setup works because ``uv`` manages dependencies in isolated virtual environments for each project.

    The LeRobot BYOH Hardware Plugin source code for integrating Trossen AI arms (including BiWidowXAIFollower support) is available at:
    `TrossenRobotics/lerobot_trossen - main <https://github.com/TrossenRobotics/lerobot_trossen.git>`_

Collect Episodes using LeRobot
==============================

We collect episodes using ``Interbotix/lerobot`` (LeRobot v2.1). For more information on installation and recording episodes check the following:

.. note::

    We use ``Interbotix/lerobot`` (LeRobot v2.1) for data collection because it saves episodes in the LeRobot Dataset v2 format.
    This Dataset v2 format is compatible with OpenPI's training scripts, which use LeRobot v0.1.0.
    Newer dataset formats (v3.0+) have breaking changes that are not compatible with OpenPI's training pipeline.
    
    **Version Summary:**
    
    - LeRobot v2.1 → Produces Dataset v2 format → Compatible with OpenPI training (LeRobot v0.1.0)

#. :ref:`tutorials/lerobot_plugin/setup:LeRobot Installation Guide`
#. :ref:`tutorials/lerobot_plugin/record_episode:Record Episodes`

Here is a recorded dataset using the above instructions:

- `Bimanual WidowX-AI Handover Cube <https://huggingface.co/datasets/TrossenRoboticsCommunity/bimanual-widowxai-handover-cube>`_

You can also visualize the dataset using the following link. Just paste the dataset name in the input box.

- Visualize using `the HuggingFace visualize_dataset space <https://huggingface.co/spaces/lerobot/visualize_dataset>`_

Or you can also visualize it locally using LeRobot:

- Visualize using :ref:`tutorials/lerobot_plugin/visualize:Visualize`


Install UV
==========

Install `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>`_ for dependency management.

openpi Setup
============

Clone the repo and update its submodules:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/TrossenRobotics/openpi.git

   # Or if you already cloned the repo:
   git submodule update --init --recursive

Run the following to set up the environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 uv sync
   GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 uv pip install -e .

.. note::

   ``GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1`` is needed to pull LeRobot as a dependency.

Training
========

Before you can train on your recorded dataset, you **must** create a custom training configuration.
There are no pre-configured options for custom datasets - each dataset requires its own configuration.

Creating a Custom Training Configuration
-----------------------------------------

To train on your dataset, you need to add a custom training configuration to the ``openpi/src/training/config.py`` file.
This configuration defines the model parameters, dataset source, camera mappings, prompts, and training options specific to your dataset.

**Key Configuration Parameters:**

- **name**: A unique identifier for your training configuration (used when running the training command)
- **repo_id**: The HuggingFace dataset repository ID. Datasets are automatically downloaded from HuggingFace on first use and cached locally in ``~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/<your_huggingface_id>/``
- **default_prompt**: The text prompt describing the task (used during training and inference)
- **repack_transforms**: Maps your dataset's camera and observation names to the π0 model's expected input names
- **num_train_steps**: Total number of training iterations
- **batch_size**: Number of samples per training batch (adjust based on GPU memory)

**Dataset Location:**

- **Remote datasets**: If you specify a HuggingFace ``repo_id``, the dataset will be automatically downloaded to ``~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/<your_huggingface_id>/`` the first time you run training
- **Local datasets**: To use a local dataset, you can push it to HuggingFace first using ``huggingface-cli upload`` or modify the data loader to point to a local directory

Below is an example configuration for training on the Trossen AI dataset. **You must customize these parameters for your specific dataset:**

.. note::

    The camera mapping are used to map the camera names in the dataset to the expected input names for the π0 model.
    In this example the dataset has 4 cameras: ``top``, ``bottom``, ``left`` and ``right``.
    We map them to the expected input names of the model: ``cam_high``, ``cam_low``, ``cam_left_wrist`` and ``cam_right_wrist``.

            )


Running the Training Command
-----------------------------

After adding your custom configuration to ``openpi/src/training/config.py``, you can start training.

Run this command from the project root:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd openpi

.. code-block:: bash

    XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION=0.9 uv run scripts/train.py <your_custom_config_name> \
        --exp-name=my_experiment \
        --overwrite

**Command Arguments Explained:**

- **XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION=0.9**: Environment variable that limits JAX/XLA GPU memory usage to 90% of available VRAM. 
- **<your_custom_config_name>**: Replace with the ``name`` field from your ``TrainConfig`` (e.g., ``pi0_trossen_transfer_block``)
- **--exp-name**: A friendly name for this training run. Checkpoints will be saved to ``checkpoints/<exp-name>/``
- **--overwrite**: If a checkpoint directory with the same name exists, overwrite it. Remove this flag if you want to resume training from an existing checkpoint.

We trained on a RTX5090 and fine-tuned using LoRA.

.. note::

    - LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a technique for fine-tuning large pre-trained models efficiently.
      Instead of updating all model parameters, LoRA inserts small, trainable matrices (low-rank adapters) into certain layers (usually linear layers like attention projections).
      This drastically reduces the number of trainable parameters while keeping most of the model frozen.

    - We have also seen that a higher batch_size (e.g. 8) yields better results than a lower batch_size (e.g. 4).

Checkpoints
===========

Checkpoints are stored in the ``checkpoints`` folder at the root of your project directory.

To use a pretrained policy, download and extract the following checkpoint into your ``checkpoints`` directory:

- `π0 Fine-Tuned Checkpoint on Hugging Face <https://huggingface.co/TrossenRoboticsCommunity/pi0_trossen_transfer_block>`_
- `π0.5 Fine-Tuned Checkpoint on Hugging Face <https://huggingface.co/TrossenRoboticsCommunity/pi05_trossen_transfer_block>`_

Running Inference with Your Trained Policy
==========================================

Once training is complete and your checkpoint is ready, you can start the policy server and run the client.

Start the Policy Server
-----------------------

Launch the policy server using your trained checkpoint and configuration:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run scripts/serve_policy.py policy:checkpoint \
       --policy.config=pi0_trossen_transfer_block \
       --policy.dir=checkpoints/pi0_trossen_transfer_block/test_pi0_finetuning/19999

Start the Client
----------------

.. note::

    The client script requires the latest version of LeRobot, while the openpi repository depends on an older version for data loading.
    To prevent version conflicts, the ``trossen_ai`` package uses the ``TrossenRobotics/lerobot_trossen`` repository as its dependency.
    When using ``uv`` for package management, this setup creates a separate virtual environment for ``trossen_ai``.
    If you need to modify any LeRobot packages, ensure you are editing them in the correct environment.

Before running the client, make sure that your Trossen AI arms and cameras are properly set up and connected to your network.
You can edit the camera and arm IP address configuration directly in the script:

.. code-block:: python

   bi_widowx_ai_config = BiWidowXAIFollowerConfig(
       left_arm_ip_address="192.168.1.5",
       right_arm_ip_address="192.168.1.4",
       min_time_to_move_multiplier=4.0,
       id="bimanual_follower",
       cameras={
           "cam_high": RealSenseCameraConfig(
               serial_number_or_name="218622270304",
               width=640, height=480, fps=30, use_depth=False
           ),
           "cam_low": RealSenseCameraConfig(
               serial_number_or_name="130322272628",
               width=640, height=480, fps=30, use_depth=False
           ),
           "cam_right_wrist": RealSenseCameraConfig(
               serial_number_or_name="128422271347",
               width=640, height=480, fps=30, use_depth=False
           ),
           "cam_left_wrist": RealSenseCameraConfig(
               serial_number_or_name="218622274938",
               width=640, height=480, fps=30, use_depth=False
           ),
       }
   )

The client script provides parameters to control both the **rate of inference** and **temporal ensembling**.

The **rate of inference** determines how often the policy is queried for new actions.
Since each query is computationally expensive, frequent queries reduce the control frequency to around **10 Hz**, which can lead to jerky motions.
To avoid this, you should choose a rate that balances **smoothness** and **responsiveness**.

- According to the π0 paper, the control loop runs at **50 Hz**, with inference every **0.5 s** (after 25 actions).
- In our case, the control loop runs at **30 Hz** to align with the camera frame rate.

Practical trade-offs:

- **Rate = 50** → smoother motion, less responsive to environment changes.
- **Rate = 25** → more responsive, but noticeably jerky motion.

Depending on your setup, you may need to adjust this parameter for optimal performance.

.. code-block:: python

    self.rate_of_inference = 50  # Number of control steps per policy inference

**Temporal ensembling** is a technique for smoothing the actions generated by the policy.
It was originally introduced in the `ACT paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13705>`_, and later mentioned in the π0 paper.

While simple to implement, the **π0 appendix notes that temporal ensembling can actually hurt performance**.
Our own experiments confirmed this. We observed no benefit, so by default the temporal ensembling weight is set to ``None``.

That said, we have included an implementation of temporal ensembling in the client script for users who wish to experiment with it.

.. code-block:: python

   self.m = None  # Temporal ensembling weight (None = no ensembling)

Run the client to interact with the policy server:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd examples/trossen_ai
    uv run main.py \
        --mode autonomous \
        --task_prompt "grab red cube"

Here are some preliminary results from our experiments with the π0 and π0.5 policy on the bimanual WidowX setup.

- The π0 base checkpoint has no episodes collected using Trossen AI arms, so fine tuning is necessary.
- We collected a small dataset of 50 episodes (very small compared to other robot modalities).
- Zero-shot inference may be difficult as environment changes (color, shape, etc.) affect performance.
- Dataset collected in a highly controlled environment.

Scenarios:

1. ``openpi_trossen_ai_red_block [success]`` : Robot successfully picks up and transfers red block in second try.
2. ``openpi_trossen_ai_blue_lego [fail]`` : Robot fails due to different block size and color.
3. ``openpi_trossen_ai_environment_disturbances [fail]`` : Robot struggles under disturbances.
4. ``openpi_trossen_ai_wooden_block [fail]`` : Robot fails with wooden block, poor generalization.
5. ``openpi_trossen_ai_pi05_red_block [success]`` : π0.5 model successfully picks up and transfers red block on first try.

We used the same command for all tests:

.. code-block:: bash

    uv run main.py \
        --mode autonomous \
        --task_prompt "grab red cube"

If you want to run the client in test mode (no movement, just logs the actions that would be taken), you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    uv run main.py \
        --mode test \
        --task_prompt "grab red cube"
