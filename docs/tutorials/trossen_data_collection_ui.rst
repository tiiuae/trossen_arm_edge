Application Overview
====================

The Trossen AI Data Collection UI is organized into several sections, each providing specific functionality for managing and monitoring your data collection sessions.

Menu Bar
--------

The top menu bar provides access to key application settings and controls:

Edit
^^^^

The **Edit** menu provides access to configuration editors:

- **Robot Configuration**: Opens a YAML editor to modify robot settings including:
  
  - Camera serial numbers and resolutions
  - Arm IP addresses and models
  - Motion parameters (``max_relative_target``, ``min_time_to_move_multiplier``)
  - Camera interface selection

- **Task Configuration**: Opens a YAML editor to modify task settings including:
  
  - Task names and descriptions
  - Episode parameters (length, warmup time, reset time)
  - Recording settings (FPS, save interval, display FPS)
  - Hugging Face Hub integration
  - Operator information

Changes made through these editors are automatically saved and applied to the current session.

Calibration
^^^^^^^^^^^

The **Calibration** menu provides tools for positioning and calibrating robot arms:

- Pose arms in specific positions for calibration purposes
- Save arm positions that can be reused later
- Calibrate sensors connected to the arms
- Load previously saved positions for consistent setup

Calibration should be performed when:

- You need to save reference positions for your workflow
- Calibrating sensors attached to the arms
- Restoring arms to previously saved calibration positions

Quit
^^^^

The **Quit** menu option safely exits the application.

Keyboard Shortcuts
------------------

The application supports the following keyboard shortcuts:

Full Screen Toggle (F11)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Press :kbd:`F11` to toggle full-screen mode for the application window. This is particularly useful for:

- Moving the application between different displays
- Maximizing screen real estate on the touchscreen display
- Adjusting the window position before entering full-screen mode

**To move the application to a different display:**

#. Press :kbd:`F11` to exit full-screen mode (if the application is in full-screen)
#. Drag the application window to the touchscreen display
#. Press :kbd:`F11` again to return to full-screen mode on the correct display

Quit Application (Ctrl+Q)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Press :kbd:`Ctrl+Q` to safely exit the application.
This is equivalent to selecting **Quit** from the menu bar.


Task Management Panel
---------------------

The task management panel is located in the upper right section of the interface:

Task Selection Dropdown
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A dropdown menu displaying all available tasks configured in your task configuration YAML file:

- Shows task names (e.g., "trossen_ai_solo_dummy_2")
- Updates the session parameters when a new task is selected
- Displays "Selected new task: [task_name]" message when changed
- Automatically loads associated robot configuration for the selected task

To switch tasks:

#. Click the dropdown menu
#. Select the desired task from the list
#. The UI will update with the new task's parameters

Episode Count Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A numeric spinbox showing the target number of episodes for the current session:

- Located next to the task selection dropdown
- Default value shown (e.g., "30")
- Can be adjusted using:
  
  - **+** button: Increment episode count
  - **-** button: Decrement episode count

- This determines how many episodes will be recorded in the current data collection session

Camera View Section
-------------------

The camera view section occupies the left side of the interface and provides real-time visual feedback:

Camera Feed Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Displays live video feeds from all configured cameras:

- Typically shows 4 camera views in a 2×2 grid layout:
  
  - **Top-left**: High-angle camera (``cam_high``)
  - **Top-right**: Low-angle camera (``cam_low``)
  - **Bottom-left**: Right wrist camera (``cam_right_wrist``)
  - **Bottom-right**: Left wrist camera (``cam_left_wrist``)

- Each window shows:
  
  - Live video stream from the corresponding camera
  - The UI refreshes the displayed frames at the ``display_fps`` frequency specified in the task YAML file
  - Displays a "No Camera" icon when a camera is disconnected, not configured, or when recording is not active.

Camera Feed Display FPS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Displayed at the top of the camera view section (e.g., "Camera Feed Display FPS: 0"):

- Shows the current refresh rate of camera displays in the UI
- Controlled by the ``display_fps`` parameter in task configuration
- Values:
  
  - **0**: Camera displays are disabled (performance mode)
  - **1-5**: Low refresh rate (recommended for most use cases)
  - **10-30**: Higher refresh rate (smoother visuals, higher CPU usage)

- This only affects UI display; actual recording always uses the ``fps`` parameter
- Lower values improve performance on resource-constrained systems
- Display FPS applies to both recording and dry run modes

Progress Tracking Section
-------------------------

Located in the lower right section, this area provides real-time feedback on session progress:

Episode Progress Bar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A visual progress bar showing completion status for the current episode:

- Label: "EPISODE PROGRESS"
- Fills from left to right as the episode progresses
- Shows percentage completion of the current episode based on elapsed time vs. ``episode_length_s``
- Resets to 0% when starting each new episode
- Updates at the ``display_fps`` frequency defined in the task configuration.

Example:
- If ``episode_length_s`` is 10 seconds and 5 seconds have elapsed, progress shows 50%

Total Time Display
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Displays the total duration configured for the current episode:

- Label: "Total Time:"
- Shows the episode duration in seconds as defined by ``episode_length_s`` in the task configuration
- This is a static value displaying the target episode length (e.g., "Total Time: 10" for a 10-second episode)
- Does not track elapsed time; instead shows the total allocated time for each episode
- Helps users know the expected duration of the recording session

Log Terminal
------------

Although not always visible in the main UI, the log terminal provides detailed status messages:

- Displays real-time system messages and status updates
- Shows:
  
  - Connection status for arms and cameras
  - Episode start/end notifications
  - Error messages and warnings
  - Data saving confirmations
  - Task selection changes
  - Configuration loading status

Button Controls
===============

The UI provides several buttons for controlling the data collection process and managing hardware:

RESET ARMS
----------

Resets all connected robot arms for the chosen task to their sleep positions. This button is useful when:

- Arms have drifted from their expected positions
- Recovering from an error state

Click this button to send all follower and leader arms back to their default positions.

HARDWARE RESET CAMERAS
-----------------------

Performs a hardware reset of all connected cameras. Use this button when:

- Camera feeds become unresponsive or frozen
- You experience video quality issues
- Cameras fail to initialize properly

This will reinitialize all camera connections and restart the video streams.

START RECORDING SESSION
------------------------

Begins a new data collection session for the selected task. When clicked:

- Initiates the warmup period (as defined in ``warmup_time_s``)
- Starts recording robot actions and camera feeds
- Begins the episode timer
- Changes the button state to indicate active recording

The button is colored green and is the primary control for beginning data collection.

END RECORDING SESSION
----------------------

Stops the current data collection session. When clicked:

- Terminates the active recording
- Saves the collected data for the most recently completed episodes.
- Returns the system to an idle state

The button is colored red and should be used to cleanly end a recording session.

RE-RECORD LAST EPISODE
-----------------------

Allows you to discard and re-record the most recent episode. This button:

- Becomes available while a episode is actively recording.
- Deletes the data from the currently active episode.
- Resets the episode counter to the previous value.
- Allows you to immediately start a new recording for that episode.
- The button is disabled when the episode ends and encoding begins, to prevent re-recording after the fact.

The button is colored yellow/orange and is essential for maintaining dataset quality by removing episodes with errors or unwanted behaviors.

DRY RUN
--------

Executes a practice run without saving data. This mode:

- Displays live camera feeds without recording
- Allows you to test your setup before actual recording
- Helps verify that all hardware is functioning correctly

The button is colored gray and is useful for:

- Testing camera angles and positions
- Verifying robot movements and workspace
- Practicing the task before formal data collection
- Troubleshooting system issues without creating dataset entries

Configuring the Robots
======================

The Trossen AI Data Collection UI provides a user-friendly interface for configuring robot settings such as **camera serial numbers** and **arm IP addresses**.
To configure the robot, follow these steps:

#. Launch the application and click on ``Edit`` in the top-left menu. Then select ``Robot Configuration``.
#. In the ``Robot Configuration`` window, you will be able to modify the YAML file that contains all robot-specific settings.
#. Update the relevant fields such as camera serial numbers and arm IP addresses as needed.

We support three robot configurations ``trossen_ai_stationary``, ``trossen_ai_mobile``, and ``trossen_ai_solo``.

An example configuration for the stationary robot is shown below:

.. code-block:: yaml

    trossen_ai_stationary:

        max_relative_target: null

        min_time_to_move_multiplier: 3.0

        camera_interface: 'opencv'

        leader_arms:
            right:
                ip: '192.168.1.3'
                model: 'V0_LEADER'
            left:
                ip: '192.168.1.2'
                model: 'V0_LEADER'

        follower_arms:
            right:
                ip: '192.168.1.5'
                model: 'V0_FOLLOWER'
            left:
                ip: '192.168.1.4'
                model: 'V0_FOLLOWER'

        cameras:
            cam_high:
                serial_number: 000123456789
                width: 640
                height: 480
                fps: 30
            cam_low:
                serial_number: 000123456789
                width: 640
                height: 480
                fps: 30
            cam_right_wrist:
                serial_number: 000123456789
                width: 640
                height: 480
                fps: 30
            cam_left_wrist:
                serial_number: 000123456789
                width: 640
                height: 480
                fps: 30

- ``max_relative_target``: Limits the magnitude of the relative positional target vector for safety purposes.
  Set this to a positive scalar to have the same value for all motors.
  The magnitude defines the maximum distance (in radians for rotational joints and meters for linear joints) that the end-effector can be commanded to move in a single command.
  When you feel more confident with teleoperation or running the policy, you can extend this safety limit and even remove it by setting it to ``null``.

- ``min_time_to_move_multiplier``:  Multiplier for computing minimum time (in seconds) for the arm to reach a target position.
  The final goal time is computed as: min_time_to_move = multiplier / fps.
  A smaller multiplier results in faster (but potentially jerky) motion.
  A larger multiplier results in smoother motion but with increased lag.
  A recommended starting value is 3.0.

- ``camera_interface``: Set this according to the camera interface you want to use.

  - ``opencv`` is the default and recommended option.
  - ``intel_realsense`` can be used if you have Intel RealSense cameras connected to the system.

- ``leader_arms``: Contains the IP addresses and models of the leader arms.

  - ``ip``: Update the IP addresses to match those assigned to your leader arms.
  - ``model``: The currently supported leader arm model is ``V0_LEADER``.

- ``follower_arms``: Contains the IP addresses and models of the follower arms.

  - ``ip``: Update the IP addresses to match those assigned to your follower arms.
  - ``model``: The currently supported follower arm model is ``V0_FOLLOWER``.

  .. note::

    Refer to :ref:`tutorials/lerobot/configuration:Setup IP Address` for more details on obtaining IP addresses.

- ``cameras``: The ``cameras`` section defines the configuration for each camera used in the system.
  Each camera entry (such as ``cam_high``, ``cam_low``, ``cam_right_wrist``, and ``cam_left_wrist``) includes:

    - ``serial_number``: The unique identifier for the camera device.
      For ``intel_realsense`` cameras, use the actual device serial number (e.g., 123456789).
      For ``opencv`` cameras, specify the camera index (e.g., 0, 1, 2).
      Refer to :ref:`tutorials/lerobot/configuration:Camera Serial Number` for instructions on finding serial numbers for both Intel RealSense and OpenCV cameras.
      
    - ``width``: The width of the camera image in pixels.
    - ``height``: The height of the camera image in pixels.
    - ``fps``: The desired frames per second for capturing images.

  .. note::

    - Do not change the camera names (e.g., ``cam_high``, ``cam_low``, etc.) as they are referenced in the application for creating predefined robot layouts.
    - Ensure that the specified FPS is supported by the camera hardware.
    - Larger resolutions may require more processing power and could impact the overall system performance.

Configuring the Tasks
=====================

The Trossen AI Data Collection UI allows users to configure various tasks for data collection.
To configure tasks, follow these steps:

#. Launch the application and click on ``Edit`` in the top-left menu.
   Then select ``Task Configuration``.
#. In the ``Task Configuration`` window, you will be able to modify the YAML file that contains all task-specific settings.
#. Update the relevant fields such as task names, parameters, and other configurations as needed.

An example configuration for tasks is shown below:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - task_name: "trossen_ai_stationary_dummy"
      robot_model: "trossen_ai_stationary"
      task_description: "A dummy task for the Trossen AI Stationary robot."
      episode_length_s: 10
      warmup_time_s: 5
      reset_time_s: 5
      hf_user: "YourUser"
      fps: 30
      push_to_hub: false
      play_sounds: true
      disable_active_ui_updates: false
      save_interval: 1
      display_fps: 1
      operators:
      - name: "YourOperator0"
        email: "youroperatoremail0@example.com"
      - name: "YourOperator1"
        email: "youroperatoremail1@example.com"

- ``task_name``: Name of the task. This should be unique for each task.
  This will also set the name of the dataset.
- ``robot_model``: The robot model associated with the task.
  This should match one of the robot configurations defined in the robot configuration YAML.
- ``task_description``: A brief description of the task.
- ``episode_length_s``: Duration of each episode in seconds.
- ``warmup_time_s``: Time in seconds to wait before starting the episode.
- ``reset_time_s``: Time in seconds to wait after the episode ends before resetting.
- ``hf_user``: Your Hugging Face username.
  This is used if you plan to push data to the Hugging Face Hub.
- ``fps``: Frames per second for data collection.
- ``push_to_hub``: Boolean flag indicating whether to push the collected data to the Hugging Face Hub.
- ``play_sounds``: Boolean flag indicating whether to play sounds during the task.
- ``disable_active_ui_updates``: Boolean flag to disable active UI updates during the task.
- ``save_interval``: Interval in episodes at which to encode images to video and save data to disk.
  For example, if set to 5, data will be saved every 5 episodes.
  Default is 1 (save after every episode).
  Setting save interval to ``-1``, ``0``, or ``> total number of episodes`` will only save data at the end of the entire data collection session.
- ``display_fps``: Controls how often camera images are refreshed in the UI (frames per second).
  The UI uses frame-skipping to render only at the specified frequency, reducing compute load while keeping controls responsive.
  Applies to both recording and dry-run modes. Default: 1 FPS.
  Increase for smoother visuals at the cost of more processing; decrease to improve performance.
- ``operators``: Optional list of operators involved in the task.
  The operator information will be saved in ``info.json`` in the metadata folder.
  You can add multiple operators by specifying their names and email addresses.
  You can add, remove, or edit operators at any time; the most recent changes to the operator list will be reflected in the metadata.

    - ``name``: Name of the operator.
    - ``email``: Optional email address of the operator.

.. note::

    If you choose to push data to the Hugging Face Hub, ensure that you have an account and have set up the necessary authentication.
    Check out the :ref:`tutorials/lerobot/record_episode:Logging into Hugging Face` for more details on generating and using access tokens.

.. note::

    The video encoding process can be resource-intensive.
    This can cause longer wait times between episodes, especially if you are recording at longer episode lengths.
    To mitigate this, consider adjusting the ``save_interval`` parameter to save data less frequently or at the end of the entire session.

Experimental Features
=====================

.. note::

    The following features are experimental and may not be fully stable.
    Use them at your own discretion.


#. GPU Acceleration for Video Encoding

    The application supports GPU acceleration for video encoding using NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA support.
    To enable this feature, ensure that you have the necessary NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit installed on your system.
    You can enable GPU acceleration by setting the ``LEROBOT_GPU_ENCODING`` environment variable.

    .. code-block:: bash

        export LEROBOT_GPU_ENCODING=1

    You can also choose the GPU device by setting the ``LEROBOT_GPU_ID`` environment variable to the desired GPU index (default is 0).

    .. code-block:: bash

        export LEROBOT_GPU_ID=0

    The GOP (Group of Pictures) size for video encoding can be adjusted by setting the ``LEROBOT_GOP_SIZE`` environment variable (default is 30).
    A smaller GOP size can lead to better video quality but may increase file size.
    GPU encoding requires the GOP size to be a multiple of the FPS.

    .. code-block:: bash

        export LEROBOT_GOP_SIZE=30


Application Features
====================

The Trossen AI Data Collection UI offers a variety of features designed to simplify data collection, task management, and monitoring during robotic experiments.

#. Task Management

    - Task Names: Select predefined tasks from a dropdown menu, making it easy to start data collection for specific robotic tasks.
    - Episodes: Specify the number of episodes for the current task using the spin box. You can increase or decrease the count using the `+` and `-` buttons.

#. Recording Controls

    - Start Recording: Initiates the data collection for the selected task, beginning the recording of robot actions.
    - Stop Recording: Ends the current data collection session.
    - Re-Record: Enables the user to re-record the current episode in case of any errors during data collection, so bad episodes can be skipped and the dataset stays clean.

#. Progress Tracking

    - The GUI includes a progress bar that tracks the data collection session in real-time, displaying the percentage of completion.

#. Camera Views

    - Live Camera Feeds: You can view multiple camera angles at once while recording, making it easy to monitor the robotic arms and their surroundings as things happen.

#. Configuration Management

    - Edit Robot Configuration: The robot's YAML settings—like camera serial numbers and arm IP addresses—can be easily updated through the GUI, giving users detailed control over the robot's configuration.
    - Edit Task Configuration: Task-specific parameters can be adjusted via a YAML editor to tailor the task according to experiment requirements.

#. Quit Button

    - The application features a Quit button in the menu that lets you exit safely, making sure all your data is saved and everything shuts down properly.


Troubleshooting
===============


Arms Jittering
--------------

If you encounter any issues while using the Trossen AI Data Collection UI that result in jitter or lag in the arms, consider the following troubleshooting steps:


Check System Resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ensure that your system has sufficient CPU and memory resources available.
Close any unnecessary applications that may be consuming resources.

Explicitly Set Camera Interface to ``opencv``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are using Intel RealSense cameras and experience lag, try changing the camera interface to ``opencv`` in the robot configuration YAML file.
This can help reduce latency associated with the RealSense SDK.

Adjust ``min_time_to_move_multiplier``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the arms are moving too fast or jerkily, consider adjusting the ``min_time_to_move_multiplier`` in the robot configuration YAML file.
A smaller value can lead to faster movements, while a larger value can result in smoother but slower motions.

Disable Active UI Updates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you notice significant lag during data collection, try enabling the ``disable_active_ui_updates`` option in the task configuration YAML file.
This can help improve performance by reducing the load on the GUI during recording.

Disable Camera Views
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the camera views are causing lag, consider disabling them temporarily to see if performance improves.
This just disables the camera feeds in the GUI but does not affect data collection.
Make the ``display_fps`` parameter 0 to disable camera updates in the UI.

Changelog
=========

1.2.0
------

- Separated display FPS from control loop FPS with intelligent frame skipping and a configurable ``display_fps`` parameter (default 1 FPS), preventing camera UI updates from degrading control loop stability and responsiveness during recording while reducing UI overhead.
- Moved RGB-to-BGR color space conversion from the time-critical control loop thread to the UI rendering thread, reducing control loop workload and improving real-time control performance.
- Environment reset now runs asynchronously, allowing video encoding operations to happen in parallel with other tasks instead of blocking the UI, significantly reducing idle wait time between episodes and improving overall recording throughput.
- Throttled progress bar updates during batch saves and long operations to prevent excessive UI redraws that could cause control FPS drops.
- Logs now display as formatted HTML with proper text colors instead of raw ANSI escape codes, improving readability in the log viewer with enhanced phase logging and clearer status messages during warmup, reset, saving, and completion phases.
- Optimized log message appending by avoiding expensive full-document reads on each new log entry, eliminating UI lag during verbose logging operations, with a configurable log entry limit (default 20 entries) and automatic pruning to prevent unbounded memory growth.
- Camera layout reorganized with dynamic camera name labels displayed above each feed for easier identification, improved structure, and proper resource cleanup before hardware resets to avoid camera hardware conflicts and lock-ups.
- Dedicated "RESET ARMS" and "HARDWARE RESET CAMERAS" buttons replacing the previous checkbox-based camera feed control for clearer, more intuitive operation of hardware reset functions.
- 30-second robot connection timeout to prevent indefinite hangs during robot initialization and startup, providing faster failure detection, with improved error handling and automatic restoration of UI elements (buttons, progress bars, controls) to their correct states after failures.
- Automatic teleoperation enablement check before each episode to ensure robots requiring explicit teleop mode are properly configured before recording begins.
- Episode numbering now correctly accounts for unsaved batched episodes, preventing incorrect episode counts when using batch save intervals.
- Re-record button is now only enabled during active recording sessions to prevent accidental activation outside of valid recording contexts.
- Added F11 keyboard shortcut for full-screen toggle, allowing users to easily move the application window between displays and maximize screen usage on touchscreen displays.
