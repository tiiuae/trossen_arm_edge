Software Setup
==============

This section describes how to set up the software environment.

What You Need
=============

To get started, please make sure you have gone through the :doc:`/getting_started/hardware_setup`.

PC Network Setup
================

The Trossen Arm Controller communicates with the Linux PC via Ethernet.
As a result, the following network configurations are required on the Linux PC.

-   IPv4 Method: Manual
-   IP Address: Any unused IP addresses under the same subnet as the Arm Controller, e.g., ``192.168.1.1``
-   Subnet Mask: The same subnet mask used by the Arm Controller, e.g., ``255.255.255.0``
-   Other settings (Gateway, DNS, etc.) can be left as default

.. note::

    Per factory settings, the Arm Controller uses

    -   IPv4 method: Manual
    -   IP address: ``192.168.1.2``
    -   Subnet mask ``255.255.255.0``
    -   Gateway: ``192.168.1.1``
    -   DNS: ``8.8.8.8``

Installing the Drivers
======================

A Trossen Arm can be controlled using either the C++ or Python driver.

The Trossen Arm Linux C++ driver is distributed from a build on Ubuntu 20.04 that links to glibc 2.31.
It is provided as a static library and is statically linked to the following libraries:

.. list-table::
    :align: center
    :header-rows: 1
    :class: centered-table

    * - Dependency

Python wheels are built for Python 3.10 ~ Python 3.13 on the supported platforms.

Python
------

To install and use the Python driver, follow these steps.

#.  Set up a virtual environment (optional)

    Some of the popular package and environment management tools are listed below.
    Please setup one that suits your needs.

    -   `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_
    -   `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_
    -   `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/getting-started.html>`_

#.  Install the driver

    Depending on the nature your application, you can install the driver in a virtual environment or the system environment.

    -   Use virtual environment if the application is in pure Python
    -   Use system environment if the application is for ROS

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install trossen-arm

#.  Run a script

    .. code-block:: bash

        python3 my_script.py

C++
---

To install and use the C++ driver, follow these steps.

#.  Clone the repository

    .. code-block:: bash

        git clone https://github.com/TrossenRobotics/trossen_arm.git

#.  Install the driver

    .. code-block:: bash

        cd trossen_arm
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake .. [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install]
        make install

    If the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` argument is specified, the driver will be installed in locally.

    -   static library and cmake configurations: ``/path/to/install/lib``
    -   header files: ``/path/to/install/include``.

    Otherwise, the driver will be installed in the default locations.

    -   static library and cmake configurations: ``/usr/local/lib``
    -   header files: ``/usr/local/include``.

#.  Build a script

    Here is the file structure of a minimal CMake project.

    .. code-block:: bash

        my_project/
        ├── CMakeLists.txt
        └── my_script.cpp

    The `CMakeLists.txt` file should have the following content.

    .. code-block:: cmake

        cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

        # Set the project name and version
        project(my_project VERSION 1.0)

        # Specify the C++ standard
        set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
        set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED True)

        # Find the libtrossen_arm package
        find_package(libtrossen_arm REQUIRED)

        # Add the executable for the test
        add_executable(my_script my_script.cpp)

        # Link the libtrossen_arm library to the executable
        target_link_libraries(my_script PRIVATE libtrossen_arm)

        # Install the executable
        install(TARGETS my_script DESTINATION bin)

    Build the project.

    .. code-block:: bash

        cd my_project
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install
        make install

    Run the executable.

    .. code-block:: bash

        ./path/to/install/bin/my_script

Arm Network Setup
=================

As stated above, the Arm Controller uses the following factory network settings:

-   IPv4 method: Manual
-   IP address: ``192.168.1.2``
-   Subnet mask ``255.255.255.0``
-   Gateway: ``192.168.1.1``
-   DNS: ``8.8.8.8``

You may want to change the Arm Controller's IP address to fit your application, e.g., you have multiple arms or want to set the IP address to a static IP address in your local network.
To change the IP address, follow the :ref:`getting_started/demo_scripts:`set_manual_ip`_` demo.

.. tip::

    If you have a kit and are using a Trossen-supported framework like :doc:`LeRobot</tutorials/lerobot>`, the expected IP addresses are:

    .. list-table::
        :align: center

        * - Leader Left
          - ``192.168.1.3``
        * - Leader Right
          - ``192.168.1.2``
        * - Follower Left
          - ``192.168.1.5``
        * - Follower Right
          - ``192.168.1.4``

Software Upgrade
================

A controller firmware is compatible with a driver if their major and minor versions match exactly.
For example, the driver ``v1.3.x`` is compatible with the controller firmware ``v1.3.x``.

Typically a controller comes with the firmware compatible with the latest driver as of the manufacturing date.
As a result, when a new driver is released, the controller firmware may need to be updated.

To upgrade, follow these steps.

#.  Install the Teensy Loader CLI if not already installed

    .. code:: bash

        # Install the dependencies
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install build-essential libusb-dev

        # Clone the repository
        git clone https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/teensy_loader_cli.git

        # Compile the source code
        cd teensy_loader_cli
        make

        # Copy the executable to the system path
        sudo cp teensy_loader_cli /usr/local/bin

        # Configure the udev rules
        sudo wget -O /etc/udev/rules.d/00-teensy.rules https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/00-teensy.rules

#.  Flash the firmware

    IMPORTANT! Use the driver compatible with the current firmware to backup all configurations as in :ref:`getting_started/demo_scripts:`configuration_in_yaml`_`.

    Connect the controller to the Linux PC with a USB to micro-USB cable.

    Download the new firmware at :doc:`/downloads`.

    Unzip and flash the new firmware using the following commands.

    .. code:: bash

        # Unzip the firmware
        unzip firmware-wxai_v0.zip

        # Flash the firmware
        teensy_loader_cli --mcu=TEENSY41 -s firmware-wxai_v0.hex

.. warning::

    The expected behavior of :doc:`/getting_started/configuration` through a firmware upgrade is as follows.

    -   Upgrade, e.g., from ``v1.8.x`` to ``v1.9.x``

        -   Fields compatible with the new firmware will be retained.
        -   Fields added in the new firmware will be set to default values.

    -   Downgrade, e.g., from ``v1.9.x`` to ``v1.8.x``

        -   STRONGLY NOT RECOMMENDED
        -   All fields will be reset to default values.
        -   Default values of arm-specific fields calibrated at manufacturing, e.g., :class:`trossen_arm::JointCharacteristic`, will be replaced by one-size-fits-all values leading to degraded performance.
