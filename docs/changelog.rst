Trossen Arm Driver
==================

1.10.0
------

- Replaced the built-in ``spdlog`` dependency with a custom logging frontend, and exposed a backend hook so users can plug in the logging library of their choice.
  Related example scripts demonstrate how to use ``spdlog`` in C++ or the standard ``logging`` module or `loguru <https://github.com/Delgan/loguru>`_ in Python.
  See the :ref:`getting_started/demo_scripts:`error_recovery_and_logging`_` demo for details.
- Fixed parsing of some error messages surfaced from the OS, e.g., now you should get ``Failed to send UDP message to 192.168.1.2:50000 due to Network is unreachable`` instead of ``due to Success``.
- :member:`trossen_arm::StandardMotorParameters::wxai_v0_default` now aliases :member:`trossen_arm::StandardMotorParameters::wxai_v0_20260317`, completing the default parameter change announced in v1.9.3.
  The same gains ship as the boot defaults in Arm Controller firmware v1.10.0, so arms running matched firmware and driver use the new tuning out of the box.
  The corresponding :enumerator:`trossen_arm::Notice::default_motor_parameters_20260317` has been suppressed.

1.9.3
-----

- Added :func:`trossen_arm::TrossenArmDriver::discover`, a static method that scans a subnet for reachable arm controllers and returns a :class:`trossen_arm::DiscoverResult` for each one with its model, firmware version, IP, and error state.
  Demonstrated in the :ref:`getting_started/demo_scripts:`arm_discovery`_` demo.
- Promoted :enum:`trossen_arm::ErrorState` and the :var:`trossen_arm::ERROR_INFORMATION`, :var:`trossen_arm::MODEL_NAME`, and :var:`trossen_arm::MODE_NAME` maps from private to public so user code can render error and identifier strings.
- Added a ``trossen-arm`` :doc:`command-line tool <getting_started/cli>` with ``discover``, ``identify``, and ``usage`` subcommands.
  Install it alongside the Python package via ``pip install "trossen_arm[cli]"``.
- :func:`trossen_arm::TrossenArmDriver::configure` now respects small ``timeout`` values without depending on operating system's TCP connection timeout.
- Added :func:`trossen_arm::TrossenArmDriver::clear_error`, a convenience method that internally calls :func:`trossen_arm::TrossenArmDriver::cleanup` with ``reboot_controller = false`` and then :func:`trossen_arm::TrossenArmDriver::configure` with ``clear_error = true``.
- Added :class:`trossen_arm::StandardMotorParameters`, a collection of named, dated motor parameter sets that can be passed to :func:`trossen_arm::TrossenArmDriver::set_motor_parameters` instead of hand-tuning gains.
  The currently shipped sets are :member:`trossen_arm::StandardMotorParameters::wxai_v0_20250509` and :member:`trossen_arm::StandardMotorParameters::wxai_v0_20260317`, with :member:`trossen_arm::StandardMotorParameters::wxai_v0_default` aliasing whichever set is the current default.
  Demonstrated in the :ref:`getting_started/demo_scripts:`set_motor_parameters`_` demo.
- Added a notice system for surfacing one-time messages from the driver at startup.
  Each notice can be silenced individually by calling :func:`trossen_arm::TrossenArmDriver::disable_notice` with the corresponding :enum:`trossen_arm::Notice` value before constructing the driver.
- Issued :enumerator:`trossen_arm::Notice::default_motor_parameters_20260317`: the default motor parameters will change from :member:`trossen_arm::StandardMotorParameters::wxai_v0_20250509` to :member:`trossen_arm::StandardMotorParameters::wxai_v0_20260317` in the next minor release (v1.10.0).
  To opt in early or pin to the old defaults, set motor parameters explicitly as in the :ref:`getting_started/demo_scripts:`set_motor_parameters`_` demo.
- Switching into :enumerator:`trossen_arm::Mode::velocity`, :enumerator:`trossen_arm::Mode::external_effort`, or :enumerator:`trossen_arm::Mode::effort` now starts from a zero command instead of seeding from the latest measurement, preventing unintended motion at the moment the mode changes.
- Fixed two interpolation issues that caused unstable motion when trajectory goals were updated at a rate close to the trajectory evaluation rate:

  - Trajectory start time is now anchored to the moment ``robot_input_`` is evaluated, so consecutive trajectories remain continuous across transitions regardless of host scheduling.
  - Pre-run inverse-kinematics feasibility checking on Cartesian trajectories is now opt-in (previously on by default), removing a substantial per-call cost in tight control loops.
  - Very short trajectory durations are handled robustly: under 1 ms uses a step, under 200 ms uses linear interpolation, otherwise uses linear, cubic, and quintic interpolations for effort, velocity, and position commands with feed-forward terms default to zero when not specified.

- Fixed a race in spdlog logger registration that could throw when multiple :class:`trossen_arm::TrossenArmDriver` instances were constructed concurrently from different threads.
- Fixed a segfault in the C++ demos: https://github.com/TrossenRobotics/trossen_arm/pull/179.
- The `C++ demo template <https://github.com/TrossenRobotics/trossen_arm/blob/76599407313fa35589c4573124ed4d2a501baa42/demos/cpp/CMakeLists.txt>`_ now uses a guarded ``find_package(libtrossen_arm)``, so a standalone demo build no longer fails when the package is not pre-installed.

1.9.1
-----

- Removed the following deprecated getter functions from both C++ and Python APIs.
  Use the ``get_all_*`` variants instead:

  - ``get_positions`` -> ``get_all_positions``
  - ``get_velocities`` -> ``get_all_velocities``
  - ``get_efforts`` -> ``get_all_efforts``
  - ``get_external_efforts`` -> ``get_all_external_efforts``
  - ``get_compensation_efforts`` -> ``get_all_compensation_efforts``

- All ``get_*`` functions now return copies instead of ``const`` references.
  This prevents dangling reference issues when the underlying data is updated by the daemon thread.
- TCP send and receive timeouts are now both applied using the user-specified timeout value.
- Fixed an uncaught exception during Ethernet connection handling.
- Added wheel builds for Python 3.13 on Linux (x86_64 and arm64) and macOS (Apple Silicon).
- All ``critical`` log messages now append a link to the troubleshooting guide at ``https://docs.trossenrobotics.com/trossen_arm/main/troubleshooting.html``.
- On successful connection, the driver now logs the client IP address along with the TCP and UDP port numbers.

1.9.0
-----

- Moved :ref:`getting_started/configuration:position_offset` to EEPROM so it persists across power cycles as other joint characteristics.
- Added :class:`trossen_arm::RobotOutput::Header` that contains :member:`trossen_arm::RobotOutput::Header::id` and :member:`trossen_arm::RobotOutput::Header::timestamp`.

1.8.8
-----

- Warned instead of throwing an exception at calling :func:`trossen_arm::TrossenArmDriver::set_end_effector` when the gripper joint is in position mode.

1.8.7
-----

- Added a temporary implementation for :ref:`getting_started/configuration:position_offset`.
  Different from its fellow joint characteristics, it currently initializes to zeros at driver configuration and resets at cleanup.
  This peculiarity will be addressed in the next minor update.
- Threw exceptions when setting configurations that may cause sudden movements while joints are in position mode.
  The following methods are affected:

  - :func:`trossen_arm::TrossenArmDriver::set_joint_characteristics` and all its helper methods

    - :func:`trossen_arm::TrossenArmDriver::set_effort_corrections`
    - :func:`trossen_arm::TrossenArmDriver::set_friction_constant_terms`
    - :func:`trossen_arm::TrossenArmDriver::set_friction_coulomb_coefs`
    - :func:`trossen_arm::TrossenArmDriver::set_friction_transition_velocities`
    - :func:`trossen_arm::TrossenArmDriver::set_friction_viscous_coefs`
    - :func:`trossen_arm::TrossenArmDriver::set_position_offsets`

  - :func:`trossen_arm::TrossenArmDriver::set_end_effector`

1.8.6
-----

- Fixed a deadlock introduced in 1.8.4 with the new logging system.
  Please update to this version if the driver hangs when throwing an exception in Python.
- Added a new demo :ref:`getting_started/demo_scripts:`gravity_compensation_partial`_` demonstrating how to compensate for a portion of the gravity.
- Relaxed NumPy requirement from ``>= 2.0.0`` to ``>= 1.22.4``.

1.8.5
-----

- Fixed an issue in the C++ driver where some of the configuration getters would fail due to internal logic errors.

1.8.4
-----

- Added the :func:`trossen_arm::TrossenArmDriver::get_is_configured` method that returns whether the driver is configured or not.
- C++ libraries are now built on Ubuntu 20.04 to maintain compatibility with older Linux distributions.
- `spdlog <https://github.com/gabime/spdlog>`_ is now used for logging for the C++ library and its capabilities are exposed to Python for use with `the Python logging module <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html>`_.
  This allows users to configure the driver's logging level, format, and preferred sinks.
  See the :ref:`getting_started/demo_scripts:`error_recovery_and_logging`_` demo for usage.
- Added a demo for finetuning joint characteristics.
  It is available in :ref:`getting_started/demo_scripts:`joint_characteristics_finetune`_`.

1.8.3
-----

- Added new models :enumerator:`trossen_arm::Model::vxai_v0_left` and :enumerator:`trossen_arm::Model::vxai_v0_right`.
  These models are 7-DOF arms to be released in the future.
  All features except for the Cartesian space inputs are supported.
- Adjusted UDP message lost logging behavior to avoid flooding the terminal.
  The driver now only warns when there are more than 1000 messages lost among each 5000 messages.
- Added initial implementation for custom end effectors.
  The original rack-and-pinion gripper can be removed or replaced with a custom end effector.
  For more details, see :ref:`getting_started/configuration:end effector`.

1.8.2
-----

- Moved the default tool frame from a point on the contacting surfaces to the tips of the fingers.
- Added pre-run trajectory check to :func:`trossen_arm::TrossenArmDriver::set_cartesian_positions`.
  Now the driver by default samples 1000 points on the trajectory and checks if they have the corresponding inverse kinematics solutions before moving.
- Added a demo for configuring joint limits.
  It is available in :ref:`getting_started/demo_scripts:`set_joint_limits`_`.
- Fixed two issues related to mixed interpolation spaces and updated the demo :ref:`getting_started/demo_scripts:`mixed_interpolation_space`_`.

  - Using joint space commands immediately after Cartesian space commands no longer causes unexpected behavior. (`trossen_arm#78`_)
  - Using Cartesian space commands immediately after setting to the corresponding mode no longer causes unexpected behavior.

.. _`trossen_arm#78`: https://github.com/TrossenRobotics/trossen_arm/issues/78

.. warning:: Trossen Arm Driver :ref:`changelog:1.8.1` has been yanked due to potentially unsafe behavior on mode switching.

1.8.1
-----

- Updated mode switching logic to no longer skip joints whose mode did not change.

  This resolves `trossen_arm#71`_, which caused unexpected arm movement during mode transitions.

  The root cause was that the interpolation space resets to joint mode, requiring the interpolator to also reset.
  Without this, Cartesian values could be incorrectly interpreted as joint values.

.. warning:: Trossen Arm Driver :ref:`changelog:1.8.0` has been yanked due to potentially unsafe behavior on mode switching.

.. _`trossen_arm#71`: https://github.com/TrossenRobotics/trossen_arm/issues/71

1.8.0
-----

- Added a new :enumerator:`trossen_arm::Mode::effort` mode.
  It allows commanding the effort of the joints without any built-in compensation like in the :enumerator:`trossen_arm::Mode::external_effort` mode.
  This mode is useful for applications where full control of the joint efforts is desired.
- Grouped the outputs into a single new class :class:`trossen_arm::RobotOutput` and added the additional fields below:

  - :member:`trossen_arm::RobotOutput::Joint::All::compensation_efforts`
  - :member:`trossen_arm::RobotOutput::Joint::All::rotor_temperatures`
  - :member:`trossen_arm::RobotOutput::Joint::All::driver_temperatures`
  - :member:`trossen_arm::RobotOutput::Cartesian::positions`
  - :member:`trossen_arm::RobotOutput::Cartesian::velocities`
  - :member:`trossen_arm::RobotOutput::Cartesian::external_efforts`

- Added helpful output getters to extract the members of :class:`trossen_arm::RobotOutput`.

  - :func:`trossen_arm::TrossenArmDriver::get_external_efforts`
  - :func:`trossen_arm::TrossenArmDriver::get_compensation_efforts`

- Added methods for commanding Cartesian inputs with respect to a tool frame.

  - :ref:`getting_started/demo_scripts:`cartesian_position`_`
  - :ref:`getting_started/demo_scripts:`cartesian_velocity`_`
  - :ref:`getting_started/demo_scripts:`cartesian_external_effort`_`

- Made driver-controller connection more user-friendly with retry, timeout, and allowing interruption.

- For C++ users, ``double`` is now used instead of ``float`` for all the data types.
  This improves compatibility with other modern libraries.

Trossen Arm Controller Firmware
===============================

1.10.0
------

1.9.4
-----

- Switching into :enumerator:`trossen_arm::Mode::velocity`, :enumerator:`trossen_arm::Mode::external_effort`, or :enumerator:`trossen_arm::Mode::effort` now starts from a zero command instead of seeding from the latest measurement, preventing unintended motion at the moment the mode changes.
- Lowered sensitivity to transient CAN bus failures by triggering motor feedback error on two consecutive lost messages instead of one.

1.9.3
-----

- Fixed an issue where the controller would sometimes fail to ignore invalid UDP packets, leading to unexpected behavior.

1.9.2
-----

- Minor improvements to user experience.

1.9.1
-----

- Fixed an issue introduced in v1.9.0 where the controller would throw an error if the gripper was not detected.

1.8.0
-----

- Added the associated interface for the new effort mode.
- Added rotor and driver temperatures to the output.
- Added the associated interface for soft reboot.
