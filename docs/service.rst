Arm Homing
==========

If a motor is replaced or if the arm loses its position for any reason, it is necessary to home the arm.
The process for homing the arm is as follows:

#.  Power off the arm.
#.  Remove the gripper fingers or paddles from the gripper carriages.
#.  Install the homing jigs on the base and wrist rotate motors.

#.  Close the gripper carriages such that they are both in contact with the retainer bearing housing.

#.  Power on the arm.
#.  Download, unzip, and run the :download:`Trossen Arm Homing script </_downloads/trossen_arm_homing.zip>`.
#.  Follow the instructions in the script to home the arm.
#.  Power off the arm.
#.  Remove the homing jigs from the base and wrist rotate motors.
#.  Reinstall the gripper fingers or paddles on the gripper carriages.
#.  Your arm is now homed and ready for use!

.. note::

    If you would like to print your own homing jigs, you can use the Trossen-provided STEP files to do so.
    STEP files for the homing jigs can be found in the :ref:`Downloads <downloads:homing jigs>` section of the documentation.
    We print these in PLA on a Prusa Mk3 printer with the following settings:

    - 0.2mm layer height
    - 0.4mm nozzle
    - 3 perimeter walls
    - 25% infill
    - Gyroid infill

Gripper Encoder Test
====================

Occasionally, the encoder in the gripper motor malfunctions and reads incorrect values.
This can cause issues including but not limited to:

-   Gripper position of a follower does not match the leader gripper position during teleoperation.
-   Position limit exceeded error: ``[ERROR] [Motor Interface] Joint 6 position limit exceeded: expected in range [-0.004000, 0.044000], motor reported x.xxxxxx. Setting to idle.``

Please follow the steps below to test the encoder.

#.  Download, unzip, and run the :download:`Encoder Test Script<_downloads/encoder_test.zip>`.
#.  Follow the instructions in the script to test the encoder.
#.  If the encoder is malfunctioning, please contact us at https://www.trossenrobotics.com/support.
