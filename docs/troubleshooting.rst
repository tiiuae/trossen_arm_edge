-   ``[WARNING] Among the last 5000 UDP messages expected from 192.168.1.2:50000, 4756 messages were lost``
-   Driver hangs forever

Common causes and associated solutions to these issues are listed below.

-   Controller Not Powered On

    If the controller is not powered on, the driver will not be able to connect to it.

    To resolve this, check that the controller is powered on and the status LED is solid green.

-   Controller Not Connected to the Network

    If the controller is not connected to the network, the driver will not be able to connect to it.

    To resolve this, check that the controller is connected to the network and the network cable is plugged in on both ends.

-   Misconfigured Controller IP Address

    If the controller's IP address is not set correctly when configuring the driver, the driver will not be able to connect to it.

    To resolve this, check that the controller's IP address is set correctly in the driver's configuration.

    .. tip::

        You can use nmap to search for the controller's IP address on the network.
        For example, if the controller's IP address is in the ``192.168.1.X`` subnet, you can run the following command to scan that subnet for devices:

        .. code-block:: bash

            nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

-   Misconfigured Network Settings

    The driver and controller must be on the same network to communicate with each other.

    -   If there are multiple network interfaces such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi, check that the one connected to the controller is configured with an IP address in the same subnet as the controller's IP address.
    -   If the driver is running on a virtual machine or a docker container, check that the traffic is directly routed to the subnet that the controller is on, e.g., `host network driver in Docker`_ and `bridged network driver in VirtualBox`_.
    -   If there is a firewall enabled on the host machine, check that TCP and UDP traffic are allowed.

.. _`host network driver in Docker`: https://docs.docker.com/network/host/
.. _`bridged network driver in VirtualBox`: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_bridged

-   Incompatible Driver Version

    If the driver version is not compatible with the controller firmware version, the driver will not be able to connect to it.
    Driver and firmware versions are compatible if they have the same minor version number.

    See the guide on updating the controller firmware in :ref:`getting_started/software_setup:Software Upgrade` for more information.

-   Another driver owning the Controller

    If a driver is configured without being cleaned up or deconstructed, other instances of the driver will not be able to connect to the controller.

    To resolve this, check that there are no other instances of the driver owning the controller.

-   Resource Limitations

    If the host machine is running out of resources such as CPU, memory, or network bandwidth, the driver may not be able to maintain a stable connection to the controller.

    To resolve this, check that the host machine has sufficient resources.

-   Outdated Controller Firmware

    If the driver is killed in exceptional circumstances, controller firmware older than 1.9.2 inclusively is known to hang and don't respond to the driver until it's power cycled.

    To resolve this, update the firmware to version 1.9.3 or later.

-   Outdated Driver

    Drivers older than 1.9.0 inclusively will hang forever in cases like controller being unresponsive or controller owned by another driver.

    To resolve this, update the driver to version 1.9.1 or later, which will throw an exception instead of hanging forever.

Stiff Leader Arm
================

If the leader arm or gripper feels stiff or resistant to back-driving during teleoperation, the joint friction compensation may be tuned conservatively for your particular arm or application.
Each arm ships with calibrated defaults that work for most applications, but they can be fine-tuned to your preference.

In most cases, the parameter to focus on is :member:`trossen_arm::JointCharacteristic::friction_constant_term`.
Increasing it uniformly reduces resistance across all velocities and efforts, and is usually enough on its own to resolve a stiff-feeling arm.
To tune it:

1.  Put the arm in gravity compensation mode so all external efforts are zero.
2.  Working one joint at a time from gripper to base, increase ``friction_constant_term`` until the joint moves freely.
    Back off if the joint starts to drift on its own without being touched.

The other friction parameters (``friction_coulomb_coef``, ``friction_viscous_coef``, and ``friction_transition_velocity``) are available for finer adjustments, but most stiffness issues are solved with the constant term alone.

To make this iterative process easier, the repository ships an interactive tuning tool at `scripts/tuning.py <https://github.com/TrossenRobotics/trossen_arm/blob/main/scripts/tuning.py>`_ that lets you adjust each joint's characteristics live from the terminal and immediately feel the result on the arm.
Run it with ``uv run scripts/tuning.py [--ip 192.168.1.2]``.
See `scripts/README.md <https://github.com/TrossenRobotics/trossen_arm/blob/main/scripts/README.md>`_ for details.

For the full friction model, parameter ranges, and the complete tuning guideline, see :ref:`getting_started/configuration:friction_transition_velocities, friction_constant_terms, friction_coulomb_coefs, and friction_viscous_coefs`.

Error Codes

Expected Error Handling Behavior
--------------------------------

Depending on when the error occurs, the Trossen Arm exhibits different behaviors.

    *   -   Timing of Error
        -   Expected Behavior
    *   -   At startup
        -   -   The controller LED flashes red
            -   LEDs on the joints are solid red
            -   Joints don't output any torque

            -   The gripper closes with a safe force

Specific Error States
---------------------

The next step is to identify and resolve the specific error state.

After carrying out the proposed solution, please do one of the following.

-   restart the controller (recommended)
-   clear the error at the driver's ``configure(...)`` call
